# COVID Vaccination Monitoring Dashboard

Welcome to my COVID Vaccination Monitoring Dashboard project, where I present interactive visualizations to track the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations worldwide. 

## Project Overview

In this project, I have developed interactive visualizations on the following key aspects of COVID-19 vaccinations:

1. **People Fully/Partially Vaccinated:** Visualizations that show the proportion of the population that is fully or partially vaccinated, helping to monitor progress towards herd immunity.

2. **People with at Least One Vaccine Dose:** Metrics on the percentage of people who have received at least one vaccine dose, highlighting the initial steps in the vaccination process.

3. **Impact of GDP per Capita:** Exploring how a country's GDP per capita affects vaccination rates. Does economic strength correlate with better vaccination coverage?

## Data Sources

The project utilizes COVID-19 vaccination data from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations).
